# TODO

## 2025 Fixups

- Prevent images from being rotated!
- Make sure .mp4 link is generated and works
- Audit 2025: e.g. Zach loses to Julie despite having higher-ranked gift.

## Submission app

## SMP app

- Improve API for directly loading profile from Google Sheets (don't go by way of streamlit)

## SMP

- brute force to optimize rank signature directly
    - local optimization if n is too large, via optimates
- optimality proofs
- make Kemeny-Young work
    - ranked pairs
- allow unlisted items
- unit testing: check stability/optimality properties
    - hypothesis with random preference inputs
